# India-CPI-Inflation

**Objective 1**

Breakdown of CPI Contribution by Broad Categories: It requests an identification of how different large categories like food, energy, transportation, and education contribute to the overall CPI calculation, using the latest month's data. Similar sub-categories should be grouped into broader buckets (e.g., meals, beverages, and cereals into "Food"). The goal is to determine which of these broader categories has the biggest impact on the CPI. The contribution should be calculated using the underlying index values for these broader categories, and the sum of contributions from all categories should equal 100%.


**Objective 2**

Year-over-Year CPI Inflation Trend Since 2017: It asks for an analysis of the year-over-year increase in combined rural and urban CPI inflation starting from 2017. This involves creating a graph to visualize the growth rate and pinpointing the year with the highest inflation rate. Furthermore, it requires identifying the reasons behind the highest inflation in that specific year, based on research.


**Objective 3**

Analysis of Recent Retail Food Inflation: Given that India's retail inflation reached a three-month high of 5.55% in November 2023, primarily due to increased food prices, the following needs to be analyzed for the 12 months ending in May 2023:
        Examine the price trends within the broader "food bucket" category and assess the month-over-month changes. Identify the months with the highest and lowest food inflation during this period.
        Determine the overall change in inflation across these 12 months. Within the broader food category, pinpoint the specific individual category that contributed the most to this overall inflation.


**Objective 4**

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on India's Inflation: Investigate how the beginning and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced inflation rates in India. Specifically, analyze the impact of key pandemic milestones (like the first lockdown) on the CPI inflation percentage, focusing on important sectors such as healthcare, food, and essential services. The analysis should consider March 2020 as the start of the COVID-19 impact and compare inflation trends before and after this period to identify any significant changes.

**Objective 5**

Influence of Global Economic Events on India's Inflation: Analyze how major global economic events, such as fluctuations in imported crude oil prices, have affected India's inflation. This analysis should include the impact on the prices of imported goods in general. For this specific analysis, concentrate solely on the month-on-month fluctuations in imported oil prices for the years 2021 to 2023.
Identify the trends in price changes across all categories and pinpoint the category whose inflation prices show the strongest correlation with fluctuations in imported oil prices.
